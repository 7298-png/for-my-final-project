OPOP APPLICATION 
This code represents a simple implementation of the python using the the python structure and some python formula together mostly tkinter, json,os library. The app consists of those things actually .
I can say this app is very useful to make important things in life shortcut. I named this app as OPOP. It can have your personal data and keep it in his memory and while you make the log in successful you can move to the actual page and find the viewing section where all the stored/saved data is secured .There has many important features I can share here and those are : a)nowadays ,everyone is using the card details in everywhere so I made a section called card/bank details where we can stored all our bank information and whenever we need this thing just we need to log in and check it out and wherever it is important we can use it .
b) I have added a extra information feature where we can put passport details ,home address, blood group and permanent address just incase anything is related with that .
c) I added another feature called emergency info where we can put trustable person name ,trustable person contact number ,present address ,family name. this feature will work at any emergency situation . what if the user can make the log in successfully done and after that somebody can have that information which is needed in this time and make a help for the user .
d) I also added a note feature where we can put our day routine ,next planning, occasion timing and exam timing where we can see immediate activities which we need to do .
e) the last feature is called user data where will be the users gmail id / apple id/ national id/ some of the important passowords cause nowadays we always need to make a password for each and everything so for every time we can not remember the passcode or passwords for always so we can write it there and save it as a unique name so that the user can remember the passwords .
 To run the app, ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required dependencies from the `requirements. It is all about the python and 
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
import json
import os
these are the parts which is important to install the app or run the app .
## How to run the app 
We just need to have the user details and passwords 
For new users we have to make a registration where the username and password that we need to create and press the registration button thatâ€™s it and when the registration will be completed we can use the username and passwords that we have saved while making the registration and make the log in after that we can have the  features of this app .
